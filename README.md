# ModalWindow

Project Objective
A modal window is a type of graphical user interface element that appears on top of the main content of a web page or application, and requires the user to interact with it before they can continue using the underlying content. Modal windows are often used to improve the user experience and prevent errors or confusion by providing clear and actionable instructions or feedback. However, they can also be overused or designed poorly, which can lead to frustration or confusion for users. Therefore, it's important to use modal windows judiciously and ensure that they are designed to be clear, concise, and easy to use.
